# Session_1_Printing-and-Manipulating-Text


In this study group we read through the appropriate chapter **(Chapter 2)** in the **Python for Biologist book.** 

We then congregate to discuss how we fared in the exercises at the end of the chapter. 

Thereafter we go through some additional Theory and Exercises if time permits.
